## Security Features Implemented

### Token Security
- **Secure Storage**: React Native Keychain with biometric protection
- **Device Binding**: Tokens tied to specific device fingerprints
- **Tampering Detection**: Comprehensive token integrity checks
- **Automatic Refresh**: Proactive token renewal before expiration

### Breach Detection
- **Device Changes**: Detection of authentication from new devices
- **Unusual Activity**: Pattern analysis for suspicious behavior
- **Multiple Devices**: Monitoring for concurrent device usage
- **Token Tampering**: Advanced validation of token integrity

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function during partial failures
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing authentication state management
- **Emergency Reset**: Complete system reset for critical security breaches
- **Cooldown Periods**: Prevent excessive recovery attempts

## Error Handling Improvements

### Null Safety
- All array operations now use null-safe wrappers
- Comprehensive null/undefined checking
- Safe property access for nested objects
- Error-resilient function execution

### Authentication Errors
- Enhanced error categorization and logging
- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Graceful fallback to manual authentication
- User-friendly error messages

### State Management
- Corrupted state detection and recovery
- Transition timeout handling
- Batch update error recovery
- Listener array protection

## User Experience Enhancements

### Seamless Authentication
- Automatic login bypass when valid tokens exist
- Smooth transitions between authentication states
- Clear loading indicators with contextual messages
- 7-day persistence indicator for user awareness

### Error Recovery
- Transparent error recovery without user intervention
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Clear error messages when manual intervention is needed
- Consistent UI behavior during error states

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies Added
- `react-native-keychain`: Secure token storage
- Enhanced existing services with new capabilities

### Architecture Patterns
- **Service Layer**: Modular authentication services
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling
- **State Management**: Enhanced auth state coordination
- **Security Layers**: Multi-layered security validation

### Performance Optimizations
