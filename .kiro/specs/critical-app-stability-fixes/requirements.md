# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GeoGuardian React Native app is experiencing critical stability issues that are causing crashes and preventing users from using the application. The app is showing multiple error types including TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of null, ErrorBoundary failures in AppNavigator, and Firebase authentication errors with "Batched sign in failed" messages. These issues are making the app progressively worse and require immediate resolution to restore functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Critical Runtime Errors

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to launch and run without crashing, so that I can access all features reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN it SHALL NOT throw "Cannot read property 'forEach' of null" errors
2. WHEN navigation transitions occur THEN the app SHALL handle null/undefined values gracefully in cardStyleInterpolator functions
3. WHEN React Native's internal style processing encounters null arrays THEN the app SHALL filter out null values safely
4. WHEN the AppNavigator renders THEN it SHALL NOT trigger ErrorBoundary failures
5. WHEN console errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly logged and handled without causing crashes

### Requirement 2: Fix TypeScript Compilation Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to compile without TypeScript errors, so that the build process is stable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app compiles THEN it SHALL NOT reference undefined global variables like `__DEV__`
2. WHEN TypeScript checks are run THEN all type declarations SHALL be properly defined
3. WHEN development mode detection is needed THEN it SHALL use standard Node.js environment variables
4. WHEN style patching occurs THEN it SHALL handle TypeScript type safety properly

### Requirement 3: Fix Firebase Authentication Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in successfully without authentication errors, so that I can access my account and app features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users attempt to sign in THEN Firebase SHALL NOT return "auth/invalid-credential" errors for valid credentials
2. WHEN batched sign-in operations occur THEN they SHALL complete successfully without failures
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the app SHALL handle transitions smoothly
4. WHEN Firebase initialization occurs THEN it SHALL use compatible API methods and configurations

### Requirement 4: Improve Navigation Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth navigation between screens without crashes, so that I can use all app features seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen transitions occur THEN navigation interpolators SHALL safely handle null progress values
2. WHEN tab navigation renders THEN it SHALL validate all required props before rendering
3. WHEN custom tab bars render THEN they SHALL handle missing or invalid route data gracefully
4. WHEN navigation state changes THEN error boundaries SHALL catch and handle failures appropriately
5. WHEN rapid navigation occurs THEN the app SHALL maintain stability without forEach errors

### Requirement 5: Enhance Error Recovery and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer and user, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that issues can be identified and the app can recover gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
2. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the app SHALL attempt graceful recovery instead of crashing
3. WHEN ErrorBoundaries trigger THEN they SHALL display user-friendly fallback UI
4. WHEN console errors are detected THEN they SHALL be categorized and handled appropriately
5. WHEN null safety violations occur THEN they SHALL be caught and handled with safe defaults
