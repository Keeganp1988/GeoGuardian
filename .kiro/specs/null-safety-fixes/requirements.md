# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical null safety issues in the React Native GeoGuardian app that are causing runtime errors when attempting to iterate over null or undefined arrays. The app is experiencing "Cannot read property 'forEach' of null" errors that crash the application and degrade user experience. This spec focuses on implementing defensive programming practices and null safety checks throughout the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle null or undefined data gracefully, so that the application doesn't crash when data is missing or incomplete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app encounters null or undefined arrays THEN the system SHALL provide safe fallback values
2. WHEN iterating over data collections THEN the system SHALL check for null/undefined before calling array methods
3. WHEN Firebase returns incomplete data THEN the system SHALL handle missing fields without throwing errors
4. WHEN components render lists THEN the system SHALL safely handle empty or null data states

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent null safety patterns throughout the codebase, so that similar errors don't occur in other parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing array properties THEN the system SHALL use nullish coalescing operators (??) for safe defaults
2. WHEN mapping over arrays THEN the system SHALL ensure arrays exist before iteration
3. WHEN accessing nested object properties THEN the system SHALL use optional chaining (?.) to prevent errors
4. WHEN Firebase documents are created THEN the system SHALL include default array values to prevent null states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want meaningful error messages and graceful degradation, so that I understand when data is unavailable rather than seeing crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is missing THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty states or loading indicators
2. WHEN errors occur due to null data THEN the system SHALL log meaningful error messages with context
3. WHEN components can't render due to missing data THEN the system SHALL show fallback UI elements
4. WHEN Firebase operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tools to catch null safety issues, so that these problems are prevented before reaching production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript strict null checks to catch potential issues
2. WHEN components are developed THEN the system SHALL include proper type definitions for all props and state
3. WHEN Firebase data is accessed THEN the system SHALL use proper typing to ensure data structure expectations
4. WHEN array operations are performed THEN the system SHALL include runtime checks for null/undefined values
