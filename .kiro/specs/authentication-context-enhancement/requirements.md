# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LoginScreen component expects comprehensive authentication methods and state management from the AppContext that are currently missing. The AppContext needs to be enhanced to provide proper Firebase authentication integration with sign-in, sign-up, loading states, and transition management to support the existing LoginScreen implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AppContext to provide Firebase authentication methods, so that the LoginScreen can properly authenticate users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AppContext is initialized THEN it SHALL provide a `signIn` method that accepts email and password parameters
2. WHEN the AppContext is initialized THEN it SHALL provide a `batchedSignIn` method for optimized authentication
3. WHEN the AppContext is initialized THEN it SHALL provide a `signUp` method that accepts email, password, and name parameters
4. WHEN authentication methods are called THEN they SHALL integrate with Firebase Auth services
5. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the user state SHALL be updated automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper loading states during authentication, so that I can see the progress of my login/signup attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is initiated THEN the context SHALL provide an `isAuthTransitioning` boolean state
2. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN `isAuthTransitioning` SHALL be true
3. WHEN authentication completes or fails THEN `isAuthTransitioning` SHALL be false
4. WHEN the context is initialized THEN it SHALL provide an `authLoadingState` with values: 'idle', 'signing-in', 'initializing', 'ready'
5. WHEN sign-in is initiated THEN `authLoadingState` SHALL be 'signing-in'
6. WHEN user data is being loaded THEN `authLoadingState` SHALL be 'initializing'
7. WHEN authentication is complete THEN `authLoadingState` SHALL be 'ready'

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling in authentication methods, so that users receive appropriate feedback when authentication fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication methods encounter errors THEN they SHALL throw descriptive error messages
2. WHEN Firebase authentication fails THEN the error SHALL be properly formatted and thrown
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be provided
4. WHEN authentication methods fail THEN the loading states SHALL be reset appropriately
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the `isAuthTransitioning` state SHALL be set to false

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist across app sessions, so that I don't have to log in every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the context SHALL check for existing Firebase authentication state
2. WHEN a user is already authenticated THEN their user data SHALL be loaded automatically
3. WHEN user data is loaded THEN their circle information SHALL be retrieved if available
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the context SHALL update accordingly
5. WHEN the user logs out THEN all authentication state SHALL be cleared

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication context to be backward compatible, so that existing functionality continues to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced context is implemented THEN existing `login` method SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN the enhanced context is implemented THEN existing `logout` method SHALL continue to work  
3. WHEN the enhanced context is implemented THEN existing `createCircle` method SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN the enhanced context is implemented THEN existing `joinCircle` method SHALL continue to work
5. WHEN the enhanced context is implemented THEN existing state structure SHALL remain unchanged
