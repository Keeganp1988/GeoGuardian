# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement 7-day authentication persistence and error handling fixes






  - Create null safety utility functions to handle forEach operations safely and prevent null reference errors
  - Implement secure authentication token storage service with 7-day expiration using React Native Keychain
  - Update authentication flow to automatically bypass login screen when valid tokens exist
  - Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application to fix forEach errors
  - Modify login process and app launch logic to support seamless 7-day authentication
  - Update UI components (LoginScreen, AppContext) to handle new authentication flow
  - Add security enhancements including token validation, refresh mechanisms, and breach detection
  - Implement proper error recovery mechanisms for authentication state corruption
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 2. Implement background task management and app state coordination
  - Create background task management framework with service registration system
  - Implement heartbeat monitoring service for continuous connectivity checking
  - Create location monitoring service with 10-meter radius checking capabilities
  - Implement battery and charging monitoring services with optimization logic
  - Create app state coordinator for smooth foreground/background transitions
  - Add automatic navigation to live view screen when app returns to foreground
  - Integrate background services with existing authentication system
  - Implement performance optimizations and resource management for battery efficiency
  - Add comprehensive testing for all background services and state transitions
  - Ensure all background logic (heartbeat, radius checking, battery monitoring) remains active when app is backgrounded
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_
