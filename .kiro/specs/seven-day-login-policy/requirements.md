# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive 7-day login policy with background task management for the GeoGuardian app. Users should be able to use the app without being prompted to sign in for 7 days after their initial login. The system must also handle background operations including heartbeat monitoring, radius checking, charging status, and battery monitoring while maintaining proper app state management between foreground and background modes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: 7-Day Authentication Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want to stay logged in for 7 days after signing in, so that I don't have to repeatedly enter my credentials for a week.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully signs in THEN the system SHALL store authentication credentials with a 7-day expiration timestamp
2. WHEN the app is opened within 7 days of login THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate the user without showing the login screen
3. WHEN 7 days have passed since login THEN the system SHALL require the user to sign in again
4. WHEN a user signs in again after expiration THEN the system SHALL reset the 7-day timer
5. IF the stored authentication token is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to requiring login

### Requirement 2: Seamless App Launch Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to open directly to the main interface when I'm already authenticated, so that I can quickly access my location data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches and the user has valid 7-day authentication THEN the system SHALL bypass the login screen entirely
2. WHEN the app launches and authentication is valid THEN the system SHALL navigate directly to the live view screen
3. WHEN the app launches and authentication is expired THEN the system SHALL show the login screen
4. WHEN authentication validation fails during launch THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and show the login screen

### Requirement 3: Background Task Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to continue monitoring my location and device status even when running in the background, so that safety features remain active at all times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app enters background mode THEN the system SHALL continue heartbeat monitoring
2. WHEN the app is in background THEN the system SHALL continue 10-meter radius checking
3. WHEN the app is in background THEN the system SHALL monitor device charging status
4. WHEN the app is in background THEN the system SHALL monitor battery percentage
5. WHEN the app returns to foreground THEN the system SHALL display the live view screen with current data
6. IF background tasks fail THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and log appropriate errors

### Requirement 4: Robust Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully without crashing, so that I have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN array operations are performed THEN the system SHALL check for null/undefined values before calling forEach
2. WHEN authentication state changes occur THEN the system SHALL handle rapid state transitions without errors
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL maintain offline functionality
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately and provide user-friendly feedback
5. WHEN errors are recovered THEN the system SHALL restore normal operation seamlessly

### Requirement 5: App State Coordination

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions between foreground and background modes, so that the app feels responsive and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app transitions from background to foreground THEN the system SHALL update the UI with current data within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the app transitions from foreground to background THEN the system SHALL preserve current state
3. WHEN authentication state changes during background operation THEN the system SHALL handle it appropriately on foreground return
4. IF the app is terminated and restarted THEN the system SHALL restore the appropriate state based on authentication status
5. WHEN multiple state changes occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL batch updates to prevent UI jitter

### Requirement 6: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication data to be stored securely, so that my account remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms
2. WHEN the 7-day period expires THEN the system SHALL automatically clear stored credentials
3. WHEN the user logs out manually THEN the system SHALL immediately clear all stored authentication data
4. IF the app detects security issues THEN the system SHALL clear credentials and require re-authentication
5. WHEN authentication data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use secure protocols

### Requirement 7: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to run efficiently in the background without draining my battery excessively, so that it doesn't impact my device performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background tasks are running THEN the system SHALL optimize for minimal battery usage
2. WHEN the device is low on battery THEN the system SHALL reduce background activity frequency
3. WHEN the device is charging THEN the system SHALL resume normal background activity levels
4. IF memory usage becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup procedures
5. WHEN background tasks complete THEN the system SHALL release resources appropriately
