# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive forgot password functionality to the mobile app, allowing users to reset their passwords through email verification. The feature includes forgot password links on both the login screen and user profile screen, a dedicated password reset screen, and integration with Firebase Authentication for secure password resets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

7. WHEN a user receives the password reset email THEN the email SHALL contain a link that opens the app to a password reset screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logged-in user who wants to change their password but has forgotten their current password, I want to use forgot password functionality from my profile, so that I can reset my password without logging out.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the user profile screen in the change password section THEN the system SHALL display a "Forgot Password?" link below the current password input field
2. WHEN a user taps the "Forgot Password?" link from the profile screen THEN the system SHALL initiate the same forgot password flow as from the login screen
3. WHEN a logged-in user completes the password reset process THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out and redirect to the login screen
4. WHEN the password reset is completed THEN the system SHALL display a message informing the user to log in with their new password

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who clicked a password reset link in their email, I want to securely set a new password, so that I can regain access to my account with a password I remember.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a password reset link from their email THEN the system SHALL open the app to a dedicated password reset screen
2. WHEN the password reset screen loads THEN the system SHALL validate the reset token from the email link
3. IF the reset token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL display an error message and redirect to the login screen
4. WHEN the reset token is valid THEN the system SHALL display a form for entering a new password
5. WHEN a user enters a new password THEN the system SHALL validate the password meets security requirements (minimum 8 characters, contains uppercase, lowercase, and number)
6. WHEN a user confirms their new password THEN the system SHALL verify both password fields match
7. WHEN a user submits a valid new password THEN the system SHALL update the password in Firebase Authentication
8. WHEN the password is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL display a success message and redirect to the login screen
9. WHEN the password update fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user going through the password reset process, I want clear feedback and error handling, so that I understand what's happening and can resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any password reset operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN a network error occurs during password reset THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with retry option
3. WHEN a user enters an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display real-time validation feedback
4. WHEN a password reset email fails to send THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a user tries to reset password for an email that doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a generic message for security purposes
6. WHEN a password reset link expires THEN the system SHALL inform the user and provide option to request a new reset email
