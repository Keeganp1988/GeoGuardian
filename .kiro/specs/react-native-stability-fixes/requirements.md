# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical stability issues in the React Native GeoGuardian app that are causing runtime errors and warnings. The app is experiencing module resolution failures, Firebase authentication persistence issues, and keychain service errors that impact user experience and app reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to start without module resolution errors, so that users can launch the application successfully without crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL NOT display "Requiring unknown module" errors
2. WHEN Metro bundler processes modules THEN the system SHALL resolve all module dependencies correctly
3. WHEN the app initializes THEN the system SHALL complete startup without JavaScript engine errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist between app sessions, so that I don't have to log in every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase Auth initializes THEN the system SHALL use AsyncStorage for persistence without warnings
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL store authentication state persistently
3. WHEN the app restarts THEN the system SHALL restore the user's authentication state from storage
4. WHEN Firebase Auth is configured THEN the system SHALL NOT display AsyncStorage warnings in the console

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the keychain service to work properly, so that my authentication tokens are stored and retrieved securely without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the keychain service stores credentials THEN the system SHALL use correct parameter formats
2. WHEN the keychain service clears credentials THEN the system SHALL NOT throw parameter type errors
3. WHEN keychain operations execute THEN the system SHALL handle both storage and retrieval without exceptions
4. WHEN the app uses keychain services THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling for failed operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean console output during development, so that I can identify real issues without being overwhelmed by false warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs in development mode THEN the system SHALL minimize unnecessary console warnings
2. WHEN Firebase services initialize THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable feedback
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log meaningful error messages with context
4. WHEN the app starts successfully THEN the system SHALL confirm all services are properly initialized
